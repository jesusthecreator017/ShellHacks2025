# Pathfinder

A Chrome extension that makes web browsing seamless and intuitive by taking in a natural text input request from a user, and then responding with a step-by-step guide on where to find specified information on **any** website.
Asking a question like **“Where are my classes?”** on your school website, **"How can I print out a package label?"** from the local post office, **"When does my Gym Membership end?"** within your local gym's website, etc has never been easier with Pathfinder.

Pathfinder highlights the right buttons, guides you step by step, and smartly tracks your previous — no more endless clicking or getting lost in menus.

## Inspiration
Our team drew inspiration from real struggles:  
- Helping people at UPS (especially Spanish speakers) navigate returns online.  
- The frustration of finding information on clunky school websites.  
- The idea that web browsing should feel **fluid**, not like a scavenger hunt. 

We wanted to make the web more accessible for everyone — students, workers, and even those less tech-savvy.

## What it does
- Uses the **Google A2K model** provided for the hackathon challenge.  
- Scans a site’s **sitemap** and understands your request.  
- Highlights the exact buttons and paths you need to click.  
- Guides you **step by step**, so browsing feels effortless.

## How we built it
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Tools:** VS Code (and vscode.dev), GitHub for collaboration  
- **Extra helpers:** GPT, CSS resources, cheat sheets

## Challenges we ran into
- Git commit / push / pull sync issues while collaborating.  
- MacOS version issues that blocked local VS Code updates (ended up switching to the web version).  
- Connecting the AI agent protocol with the extension.  

---

## Accomplishments we're proud of
- Building a working **Chrome extension prototype** as first-time hackers.  
- Solving tough Git and workflow issues as a team.  
- Creating a tool that has **real-world usefulness** for people of all ages.  

---

## What we learned
- Hands-on practice with **Git, repos, and team collaboration**.  
- Setting up and using **brew, terminal tools, and coding workflows**.  
- How much faster you learn when you’re building something real with a team.
